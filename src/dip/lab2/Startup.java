 * 2. Create an instance of your high-level class.
 * 3. Pass one of your calculator instances to the high-level class and
 *    check the results.
 * 4. Now switch to a different calculator instance and pass that to the
 *    high-level class. Did it work? Are the low-level instances
 *    interchangeable? The DIP requires this.
